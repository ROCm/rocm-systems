/**

 * @brief Enabling PC (Program Counter) Sampling for GPU Activity
 * @{
 */

/**
 * @brief Function used to configure the PC sampling service on the GPU agent with @p agent_id.
 *
 * Prerequisites are the following:
 * - The client must create a context and supply its @p context_id. By using this context,
 *   the client can start/stop PC sampling on the agent. For more information,
 *   please @see rocprofiler_start_context/rocprofiler_stop_context.
 * - The user must create a buffer and supply its @p buffer_id. Rocprofiler-SDK uses the buffer
 *   to deliver the PC samples to the client. For more information about the data delivery,
 *   please @see rocprofiler_create_buffer and @see rocprofiler_buffer_tracing_cb_t.
 *
 * Before calling this function, we recommend querying PC sampling configurations
 * supported by the GPU agent via the @see rocprofiler_query_pc_sampling_agent_configurations.
 * The client chooses the @p method, @p unit, and @p interval to match one of the
 * available configurations. Note that the @p interval must belong to the range of values
 * [available_config.min_interval, available_config.max_interval],
 * where available_config is the instance of the @see rocprofiler_pc_sampling_configuration_s
 * supported/available at the moment.
 *
 * Rocprofiler-SDK checks whether the requsted configuration is actually supported
 * at the moment of calling this function. If the answer is yes, it returns
 * the @see ROCPROFILER_STATUS_SUCCESS. Otherwise, it notifies the client about the
 * rejection reason via the returned status code. For more information
 * about the status codes, please @see rocprofiler_status_t.
 *
 * There are a few constraints a client's code needs to be aware of.
 *
 * Constraint1: A GPU agent can be configured to support at most one running PC sampling
 * configuration at any time, which implies some of the consequences described below.
 * After the tool configures the PC sampling with one of the available configurations,
 * rocprofiler-SDK guarantees that this configuration will be valid for the tool's
 * lifetime. The tool can start and stop the configured PC sampling service whenever convenient.
 *
 * Constraint2: Since the same GPU agent can be used by multiple processes concurrently,
 * Rocprofiler-SDK cannot guarantee the exclusive access to the PC sampling capability.
 * The consequence is the following scenario. The tool TA that belongs to the process PA,
 * calls the @see rocprofiler_query_pc_sampling_agent_configurations that returns the
 * two supported configurations CA and CB by the agent. Then the tool TB of the process PB,
 * configures the PC sampling on the same agent by using the configuration CB.
 * Subsequently, the TA tries configuring the CA on the agent, and it fails.
 * To point out that this case happened, we introduce a special status code
 * @see ROCPROFILER_STATUS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE.
 * When this status code is observed by the tool TA, it queries all available configurations again
 * by calling @see rocprofiler_query_pc_sampling_agent_configurations,
 * that returns only CB this time. The tool TA can choose CB, so that both
 * TA and TB use the PC sampling capability in the separate processes.
 * Both TA and TB receives samples generated by the kernels launched by the
 * corresponding processes PA and PB, respectively.
 *
 * Constraint3: Rocprofiler-SDK allows only one context to contain the configured PC sampling
 * service within the process, that implies that at most one of the loaded tools can use PC
 * sampling. One context can contains multiple PC sampling services configured for different GPU
 * agents.
 *
 * Constraint4: PC sampling feature is not available within the ROCgdb.
 *
 * Constraint5: PC sampling service cannot be used simultaneously with
 * counter collection service.
 *
 * @param [in] context_id - id of the context used for starting/stopping PC sampling service
 * @param [in] agent_id   - id of the agent on which caller tries using PC sampling capability
 * @param [in] method     - the type of PC sampling the caller tries to use on the agent.
 * @param [in] unit       - The unit appropriate to the PC sampling type/method.
 * @param [in] interval   - frequency at which PC samples are generated
 * @param [in] buffer_id  - id of the buffer used for delivering PC samples
 * @param [in] flags      - for future use
 * @return ::rocprofiler_status_t
 * @retval ::ROCPROFILER_STATUS_SUCCESS PC sampling service configured successfully
 * @retval ::ROCPROFILER_STATUS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE One of the scenarios is present:
 * 1. PC sampling is already configured with configuration different than requested,
 * 2. PC sampling is requested from a process that runs within the ROCgdb.
 * 3. HSA runtime does not support PC sampling.
 * 4. GPU device does not support requested PC sampling method.
