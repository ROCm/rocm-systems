# Changelog for ROCm Compute Profiler

Full documentation for ROCm Compute Profiler is available at [https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-compute/en/latest/](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-compute/en/latest/).

## Unreleased

### Added

* Support Roofline plot on CLI (single run)

* Stochastic (hardware-based) PC sampling has been enabled for AMD Instinct MI300X series and later accelerators.

* Sorting of PC sampling by type: offset or count.

* Add rocprof-compute Text User Interface (TUI) support for analyze mode (beta version)
  * A command line based user interface to support interactive single-run analysis
  * launch with `--tui` option in analyze mode. i.e., `rocprof-compute analyze --tui`

* Add support to be able to acquire from rocprofv3 every single channle on each XCD of TCC counters

* Add Docker files to package the application and dependencies into a single portable and executable standalone binary file

* Analysis report based filtering
  * -b option in profile mode now additionally accepts metric id(s) for analysis report based filtering
  * -b option in profile mode also accept hardware IP block for filtering, however, this support will be deprecated soon
  * --list-metrics option added in profile mode to list possible metric id(s), similar to analyze mode

* Data type selection option for roofline profiling
  * --roofline-data-type / -R option added to specify which data types the user wants to capture in the roofline PDF plot outputs
  * Default is FP32, but user can specify as many types as desired to overlay on the same plot output

* Additional data types for roofline profiling
  * Now supports FP4, FP6, FP8, FP16, BF16, FP32, FP64, I8, I32, I64 (dependent on gpu architecture)

* Support host-trap PC Sampling on CLI (beta version)

* Support for AMD Instinct MI350 series GPUs with the addition of the following counters:
  * VALU co-issue (Two VALUs are issued instructions) efficiency
  * Stream Processor Instruction (SPI) Wave Occupancy
  * Scheduler-Pipe Wave Utilization
  * Scheduler FIFO Full Rate
  * CPC ADC Utilization
  * F6F4 data type metrics
  * Update formula for total FLOPs while taking into account F6F4 ops
  * LDS STORE, LDS LOAD, LDS ATOMIC instruction count metrics
  * LDS STORE, LDS LOAD, LDS ATOMIC bandwidth metrics
  * LDS FIFO full rate
  * Sequencer -> TA ADDR Stall rates
  * Sequencer -> TA CMD Stall rates
  * Sequencer -> TA DATA Stall rates
  * L1 latencies
  * L2 latencies
  * L2 to EA stalls
  * L2 to EA stalls per channel

* Roofline support for RHEL 10

* Roofline support for MI350 series architecture

* Interface to rocprofiler-sdk
  * Setting ROCPROF=rocprofiler-sdk environment variable will use rocprofiler-sdk C++ library instead of rocprofv3 python script
  * Add --rocprofiler-sdk-library-path runtime option to choose the path to rocprofiler-sdk library to be used
  * Using rocprof v1 / v2 / v3 interfaces will trigger a deprecation warning to use rocprofiler-sdk interface

* Support MEM chart on CLI (single run)

* Add deprecation warning for database update mode.

### Changed

* Change the default rocprof version to rocprofv3, this is used when environment variable "ROCPROF" is not set
* Change the rocprof version for unit tests to rocprofv3 on all SoCs except MI100
* Change normal_unit default to per_kernel
* Change dependency from rocm-smi to amd-smi
* Decrease profiling time by not collecting counters not used in post analysis
* Update definition of following metrics for MI 350:
  * VGPR Writes
  * Total FLOPs (consider fp6 and fp4 ops)
* Update Dash to >=3.0.0 (for web UI)
* Change when Roofline PDFs are generated- during general profiling and --roof-only profiling (skip only when --no-roof option is present)
* Update Roofline binaries
  * Rebuild using latest ROCm stack
  * OS distribution support minimum for roofline feature is now Ubuntu22.04, RHEL9, and SLES15SP6

### Optimized

* ROCm Compute Profiler CLI has been improved to better display the GPU architecture analytics

### Resolved issues

* Fixed MI 100 counters not being collected when rocprofv3 is used
* Fixed option specs-correction
* Fixed kernel name and kernel dispatch filtering when using rocprof v3
* Fixed not collecting TCC channel counters in rocprof v3
* Fixed peak FLOPS of F8 I8 F16 and BF16 on MI300

### Known issues

* On MI 100, accumulation counters will not be collected and the following metrics will not show up in analysis: Instruction Fetch Latency, Wavefront Occupancy, LDS Latency
  * As a workaround, use ROCPROF=rocprof environement variable, to use rocprofv1 for profiling on MI 100

* GPU id filtering is not supported when using rocprof v3

* Analysis of previously collected workload data will not work due to sysinfo.csv schema change
  * As a workaround, run the profiling operation again for the workload and interrupt the process after ten seconds.
    Followed by copying the `sysinfo.csv` file from the new data folder to the old one.
    This assumes your system specification hasn't changed since the creation of the previous workload data.

* Analysis of new workloads might require providing shader/memory clock speed using
--specs-correction operation if `amd-smi` or `rocminfo` does not provide clock speeds.

* Memory chart on CLI might look corrupted if CLI width is too narrow

* Roofline support for Ubuntu 20.04 and SLES below 15.6
* Usage of rocm-smi
