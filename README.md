# ROCm System Quick Start Guide for Developers

Welcome to the monorepo for ROCm system software!

This quick start guide includes tips on how to work efficiently with this monorepo style.

## üìÇ Sparse Checkout: Working with a Subset of the Monorepo

If you only need to work on specific projects within the monorepo, you can use **sparse checkout** to limit the files in your working directory.

### Enable Sparse Checkout:
```sh
git clone --no-checkout <monorepo-url>
cd <monorepo>
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set repo1 repo2
git checkout develop
```
This ensures that only `repo1/` and `repo2/` directories are checked out.

### Reset Sparse Checkout to Full Repo:
```sh
git sparse-checkout disable
```

## üîç Viewing Old History with Subtree Split

Since the monorepo was created using **git subtree**, historical commit paths are preserved at the top-level, but per-file granularity of the commit history requires extra steps to view the history of changes before the individual repos were added to this monorepo. To view the commit history of a specific project before it was merged:

### Create a Temporary History Branch:
```sh
git subtree split --prefix=repo1 -b repo1-history
git checkout repo1-history
```

Now, you can use the typical logging commands to go through the old commit history.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è GitHub Web UI Limitations

The GitHub web interface does not correctly track file history when files are moved into a subdirectory via `git subtree`. To get the prior history of files, use the aforementioned subtree split method.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Per-Project Submodule Limitations

Submodules that were present in the individual projects are not migrated over to the monorepo when `git subtree` is used. For the reverse direction, updates to submodules on the monorepo are also not propagated to the individual repos with `git subtree push`. If an individual project has submodules, please maintain submodules in both the monorepo and the individual repos during the migration period. Also consider why the submodule is in place, and whether a better solution should be implemented for the monorepo (e.g., shared top-level directory of submodules).

---

## üîÑ Keeping the Monorepo Updated

This monorepo will run hourly jobs to synchronize the monorepo with the individual repos using the below commands. Reminder that submodules are ignored during this process.

### Pull Updates from Individual Repo:
```sh
git subtree pull --prefix=repo1 <repo1-url> <repo1-branch>
```

### Push Changes Back to the Individual Repo:
```sh
git subtree push --prefix=repo1 <repo1-url> <repo1-branch>
```
